# ibeere-api

ibeere has started out as what looks like a Nigerian Q and A site. ibeere.com

Much to the dismay of the core users, the site is on hiatus at the moment after being live for the first half of 2020. Hopefully to return in 2021 and pick up where it left off.

ibeere-api is the core api servicing the javascript on the browser, providing sitemap data, and handling email/phone user communication.

Written to support rapid development but with consistent engineering patterns as an aspiration.
